# 8-bit Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU)  

## üìå Project Overview  
This project was developed under the **EE-172 Digital Logic and Design** course at **Habib University** during Fall 2017. It demonstrates the design and implementation of an **8-bit Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU)** using fundamental **logic gates** and **integrated circuits (ICs)**. The ALU is the core computational unit of all digital computing devices, performing basic arithmetic and logic operations.

## üõ† Features  
- ‚úÖ **Binary Addition** (4-bit full adder)  
- ‚úÖ **Binary Subtraction** (using 2‚Äôs complement)  
- ‚úÖ **Binary Multiplication** (via repeated addition and logic gates)  
- ‚úÖ **User Input Handling** (DIP switches and push buttons)  
- ‚úÖ **Clock Pulsing** (555 Timer IC for counter input)  
- ‚úÖ **7-Segment Display Output** (for multiplication results)  
- ‚úÖ **LED Output Indicators** (for addition/subtraction results)  

## üèó Project Implementation  
### ‚û§ **Addition**  
- Implemented using **74LS283 4-bit Full Adder IC**.  
- Takes two 4-bit binary inputs from counters.  
- Outputs a **4-bit sum** with a **1-bit carry**, displayed using LEDs.  

### ‚û§ **Subtraction**  
- Achieved using **two‚Äôs complement** logic.  
- XOR gates (**74LS86**) invert the subtrahend when subtraction is selected.  
- The full adder then adds the two numbers, displaying the result using LEDs.  

### ‚û§ **Multiplication**  
- Implemented using **AND gates** to generate partial products.  
- **Half-adder circuits** (AND & XOR gates) sum the partial products.  
- The final output is displayed on a **7-segment display** using a **BCD to 7-segment decoder IC (74LS47)**.  

### ‚û§ **User Input & Clocking**  
- **DIP Switches**: Used for direct binary input.  
- **Push Buttons**: Used to increment counter inputs.  
- **Toggle Switch**: Selects between different arithmetic operations.  
- **555 Timer IC**: Generates clock pulses for **74LS93 4-bit binary counters**.  

## üîß Components Used  
| Component | Description |
|-----------|------------|
| **74LS283** | 4-bit Full Adder IC |
| **74LS86** | XOR Gate IC (for subtraction & multiplication) |
| **74LS08** | AND Gate IC (for multiplication) |
| **74LS93** | 4-bit Binary Counter IC (user input handling) |
| **74LS47** | BCD to 7-segment Display Decoder |
| **555 Timer IC** | Generates clock pulses |
| **Push Buttons & Toggle Switch** | User controls |
| **7-Segment Display & LEDs** | Output visualization |

## ‚ö† Design Challenges  
- **7-Segment Display Limitations**: Since standard 7-segment decoders do not support direct display of **4-bit binary numbers**, only the **multiplication output** is displayed this way.  
- **Limited Cascading Options**: Decoding dual 7-segment outputs required complex logic beyond the project scope.  

## üí∞ Cost Effectiveness  
The total cost of the project was **under PKR 1000**, as it utilized basic ICs and commonly available electronic components.  

## üìå Conclusion  
This project serves as an **introductory digital logic** design exercise, helping students understand how **basic logic circuits** integrate into larger computational systems. Though simple, it provides hands-on experience with **binary arithmetic operations, digital logic design, and hardware troubleshooting**.
